### Analysis

If you are willing to sacrifice leg room for a cheaper flight ticket, chose Ryanair to fly to Berlin this summer. Not only does it offer on average the cheaper flights, but it presents most of the cheapest flights to Berlin. However, shopping between multiple airlines on outbound and return flights may provide a slightly cheaper option than Ryanair, as seen in week 36.

Flight prices to Berlin are higher towards the end of September due to the high demand caused by the world-famous Oktoberfest celebration, drawing tourists from around the globe to the city.
