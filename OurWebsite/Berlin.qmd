Out of the seven capital cities we’ve analysed, Berlin is the most accessible with the highest number of departure airports. You are able to choose from all five airports! It is the only city with access from London City– a convenient choice for anyone in the east.

### Explanation


If you are willing to sacrifice leg room for a cheaper flight ticket, chose Ryanair to fly to Berlin this summer. Not only does it offer on average the cheaper flights, but it presents most of the cheapest flights to Berlin. However, shopping between multiple airlines on outbound and return flights may provide a slightly cheaper option than Ryanair, as seen in week 36.

Flight prices to Berlin are higher towards the end of September due to the high demand caused by the world-famous Oktoberfest celebration, drawing tourists from around the globe to the city.
