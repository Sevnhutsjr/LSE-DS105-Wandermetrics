This is evidenced by the rise in the median and quartile values across successive weeks. However, there are notable differences in the degree of increase among cities. For instance, cities like Madrid and Budapest showed considerable increase in prices, while the price rise in Paris and Berlin was more modest.Regardless of these variations, Athens consistently had the highest prices across all time windows."

    "text": "Wasserstein Distances1\n\n\n\nThe calculated Wasserstein distances reveal how the price distribution evolved over time. In general, most cities show a steady increase in the Wasserstein distances, implying a significant shift in the distribution of prices over the weeks. It is noteworthy that the distances spike notably in Paris, Berlin, and Madrid around mid-April, suggesting a dramatic change in price distribution during this period. The notable spikes observed in the Wasserstein distances for Paris, Berlin, and Madrid, cities relatively close to London, around mid-April could potentially be associated with the Easter holiday period. During this time, a surge in flight search volume is typically observed, possibly reflecting an increase in travel demand. Given their geographical proximity, travellers from London might prefer these cities as their holiday destinations, leading to an increased demand for flights to these destinations. This heightened demand could result in a sharp rise in flight ticket prices, resulting in significant shifts in price distributions, which might be the cause of the spikes observed in our analysis. Therefore, understanding the impact of seasonal holidays and considering related factors such as geographical location can provide us with a more comprehensive perspective on flight ticket pricing patterns."

    "text": "Data Overview\nThe data includes various details such as departure and arrival times, airports, airlines, booking agents, flight duration, ticket prices, etc..\n\nData distribution\n\n\n\nAll cities show a right-skewed distribution, where the mean is higher than the median, indicating that there are some higher-priced tickets pulling the mean up. This could be due to factors like premium flights or higher prices during peak travel times.\n\n\n\nCities like Paris, Madrid, and Berlin have a relatively narrow price distribution. This suggests that the price difference in these cities is smaller, and most prices are concentrated in the middle range. Cities like Athens, Lisbon, and Budapest have a relatively wide price distribution. This suggests that these cities have a larger price difference, and there may be some high-end listings. Some interesting points：\n\nData Points: Madrid has the highest number of data points, which could suggest that Madrid was a more popular destination during the data collection period. On the other hand, Budapest has the fewest data points, which could suggest fewer flight options or less popularity.\nPrice Variability: The standard deviation, which measures the variability of prices, is highest for Athens and lowest for Berlin. This could mean that prices for flights to Athens are more unpredictable, while prices for flights to Berlin are more stable\nPrice Range: Athens has the highest mean and median prices, suggesting it’s generally more expensive to fly to Athens. On the other hand, Berlin has the lowest mean and median prices, indicating it’s generally cheaper to fly to Berlin.\n\nSince all cities show a right-skewed distribution, it becomes crucial to analyse the outliers. We aim to determine if the outliers share the same properties across these cities.\n\n\nOutlier Analysis\nOur analysis identified outliers in flight ticket prices for each city using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. The number of outliers varied across cities, with Madrid having the most (814) and Budapest the least (53).\n\n\n\nCity\nParis\nBerlin\nMadrid\nLisbon\nRome\nBudapest\nAthens\n\n\n\n\nOutliers\n298\n68\n814\n72\n205\n53\n63\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Outliers per Month\n\n\n\nIn terms of monthly distribution, outliers were most common in June for most cities, except Paris and Berlin, which had the most outliers in September. August had the fewest outliers across all cities.\n\n\nNumber of Outliers per Carrier\n\n\n\nWhen examining outliers by carrier, British Airways had a significant number of outliers across all cities. For Paris, the majority of outliers were associated with easyJet, while for Madrid, outliers were almost evenly distributed between British Airways, Iberia, and Vueling Airlines.\n\n\nNumber of Outliers per Departure Airport\n\n\n\nRegarding departure airports, London Heathrow had the most outliers across all cities, suggesting that flights from this airport are more likely to have extreme prices.\n\nThese findings suggest that the month of travel, the airline, and the departure airport can significantly influence the likelihood of encountering extreme ticket prices. This information can be valuable for travellers seeking to avoid high costs."

While studying, we don’t often have the time to go away for a week, so the idea of a weekend holiday sprung to mind. As international students, the question also related to us as we were intrigued to find whether booking tickets closer to the date made them more expensive? We are also very interested where and when to book our next weekend away holiday with our student budget."

Not only does it offer on average the cheaper flights, but it presents most of the cheapest flights to Berlin. However, shopping between multiple airlines on outbound and return flights may provide a slightly cheaper option than Ryanair, as seen in week 36.\nFlight prices to Berlin are higher towards the end of September due to the high demand caused by the world-famous Oktoberfest celebration, drawing tourists from around the globe to the city.\n\n\n\n\nAirport Analysis"
