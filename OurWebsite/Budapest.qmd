### Explanation

Median prices departing from Heathrow are considerably higher than all other airports throughout, yet its minimum prices in June and July are much lower than flying from Gatwick. This contrast may be due to a wide range of flight options from Heathrow. However, it also suggests that there are limited availabilities for cheaper flights relative to more expensive options.
