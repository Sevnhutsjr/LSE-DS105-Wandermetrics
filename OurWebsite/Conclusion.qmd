## What you need to know?

In conclusion, the “ideal weekend getaway” depends on your personal preferences. 
But we have some suggestions😆:

------------------------------------------------

<br>

## Price and Flexibility

- If your main priority is flexibility, then Madrid offers an insanely flexible weekend getaway with over 600 flight combinations to choose from weekly. 

- If you are looking for a budget getaway this summer, overall the months of May and September pose to be the cheaper option.

- Your ideal choice for a budget holiday would be to Berlin in May/June or September to Lisbon or Madrid, with the cheaper tickets costing as low as 50 pound. 

- If you aren’t set with dates, try SKY express to Athens, who consistently offer lower prices than their competitors, though you may have to sacrifice flexibility, as they offer only one flight a day!

------------------------------------------------

<br>

## Booking Time Window

- Book earlier as tickets become more expensive closer to the flight date.

- However if this is a last minute decision, Paris and Berlin are your best bet and avoid Madrid and Budapest!

- If you are late, don’t worry about your flight being fully booked as closer to the date more flight options become available.

------------------------------------------------

<br>

## Departure Airport

- London Heathrow Airport is the most expensive departure airport.

- So if you’re on a budget we suggest you look at Gatwick and Stansted which are generally the cheaper option.

------------------------------------------------

<br>

## Departure Time

- Median prices for flight times are inconsistent as they constantly fluctuate throughout the day.

- Late night/early morning flights doesn’t guarantee cheaper tickets. 

- For Berlin, departing between 08.00 and 13.00 will cost more.
