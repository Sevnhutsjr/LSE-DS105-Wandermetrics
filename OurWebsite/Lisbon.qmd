### Explanation

Despite some ordinal fluctuations, the general pricing in flying to Lisbon is that either departing from Luton or Stansted offer the lowest price. There is also a fairly large difference in the minimum price of each airport such that you can fly from Luton in July peak season at the same price (or even lower) as from Heathrow in September approaching low-season.
