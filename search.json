Not only does it offer on average the cheaper flights, but it presents most of the cheapest flights to Berlin. However, shopping between multiple airlines on outbound and return flights may provide a slightly cheaper option than Ryanair, as seen in week 36.\nFlight prices to Berlin are higher towards the end of September due to the high demand caused by the world-famous Oktoberfest celebration, drawing tourists from around the globe to the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice to Berlin by Departure Time\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\nThere seems to be no relationship between flight prices and departure time for Berlin as the fluctuation seems to be random throughout the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice to Berlin by Departure Airport\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\nOut of the seven capital cities we’ve analysed, Berlin is the most accessible with the highest number of departure airports. You are able to choose from all five airports! It is the only city with access from London City– a convenient choice for anyone in the east. If you’re looking for the cheapest flight, London Stansted is your option, offering the lowest minimum price across all summer months, less than half the price of flying from Heathrow!"

Here mixing airlines will save money and help with flexibility!\n\n\n\n\nPrice to Lisbon by Departure Time\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\nAlthough there is a lot of fluctuation throughout the day, it would be safe to book for flights between 16.00-19.30 where prices are generally lowest.\n\n\n\n\nPrice to Lisbon by Departure Airport\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\nDespite some ordinal fluctuations, the general pricing in flying to Lisbon is that either departing from Luton or Stansted offer the lowest price. There is also a fairly large difference in the minimum price of each airport such that you can fly from Luton in July peak season at the same price (or even lower) as from Heathrow in September approaching low-season."

This contrast may be due to a wide range of flight options from Heathrow. However, it also suggests that there are limited availabilities for cheaper flights relative to more expensive options.

On the other hand, Budapest has the fewest data points, which could suggest fewer flight options or less popularity.\nPrice Variability: The standard deviation, which measures the variability of prices, is highest for Athens and lowest for Berlin.
